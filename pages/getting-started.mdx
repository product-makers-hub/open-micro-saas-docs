# Getting Started with Open Micro SaaS

Welcome to the beginning of your journey with Open Micro SaaS, the ultimate Next.js-based toolkit designed to streamline the development of your SaaS project.

This guide will walk you through the setup process, from cloning the repository to running your first set of integration tests. Let's get your project off the ground.

## Installation

**Step 1: Clone the repository**

Start by cloning the Open Micro SaaS repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/product-makers-hub/open-micro-saas.git
```

**Step 2: Install dependencies**

Navigate to your project directory and install the necessary dependencies. This step ensures that your project has all the tools it needs to run smoothly.

```bash
cd open-micro-saas
npm install
```

**Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**

Set up your environment variables by copying the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file. This file will store crucial configurations for your project.

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # Use 'copy' command on Windows
```

**Step 4: Set Up Next Auth Secret**

Secure your application by generating a Next auth secret. This key adds an extra layer of security to your user authentication process.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

For detailed instructions, refer to [Next Auth's documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#description-1).

**Step 5: Database Configuration**

Input your database credentials in the `.env` file. The default `docker-compose.yml` is set with the following placeholders; adjust according to your preferences:

```bash
POSTGRES_HOST=127.0.0.1
POSTGRES_PORT=6500
POSTGRES_USER=your-user-that-you-want
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-password-that-you-want
POSTGRES_DB=your-db-that-you-want
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your-user-that-you-want:your-password-that-you-want@localhost:6500/your-db-that-you-want?schema=public"
```

Ensure consistency in the `DATABASE_URL` and individual Postgres environment variables.

**Step 6: Initialize the Database**

Use Docker to set up your PostgreSQL database. If you haven't installed Docker, [find the installation guide here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```bash
npm run db:start
```

**Step 7: Launch the Development Server**

Everything's set! Start the development server and begin building:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your server will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Testing

Open Micro SaaS uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for robust integration testing, ensuring your application runs flawlessly.

**Creating and Running Tests:**

1. **Set Up the Test Database** (First-time setup)

Start by creating your test database within Docker:

```bash
npm run test:db:start
```

2. **Prepare the Database**

After creating the test database, run the migrations to set up your tables:

```bash
npm run test:db:prepare
```

3. **Execute the Tests**

Run your integration tests to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash
npm run test
```

For a more interactive testing experience, launch the tests in UI mode:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

This opens a browser window where you can watch your tests in action.

**Note:** Remember to apply new migrations to your test database whenever you create them during development.
