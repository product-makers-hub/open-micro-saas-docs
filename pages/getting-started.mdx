# Lets start building your SaaS project with Open Micro SaaS

Welcome to the beginning of your journey with Open Micro SaaS, the ultimate Next.js-based toolkit designed to streamline the development of your SaaS project.

This guide will walk you through the setup process, from cloning the repository to running your first set of integration tests. Let's get your project off the ground.

## Installation

**Step 1: Create Your Project from the Template**

Instead of directly cloning the Open Micro SaaS repository, you'll start by creating a new repository based on our GitHub template (instructions bellow).

This approach allows you to maintain a separate repository for your project, making future updates and customizations easier to manage.

1. **Navigate to the Open Micro SaaS Template Repository**: Go to the [Open Micro SaaS public template on GitHub](https://github.com/product-makers-hub/open-micro-saas).
2. **Use the Template**: Click the "Use this template" button near the top right of the repository page.
3. **Set Up Your Repository**: Choose a name for your new repository and decide if it will be public or private. Then, click "Create repository from template" to generate your new project repository.

By using the Open Micro SaaS template, you instantly inherit all the foundational elements of our toolkit, ready to be customized and expanded to fit your unique SaaS solution.

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Once you've created your project repository from the Open Micro SaaS template, the next step is to set up your project environment by installing the necessary dependencies. This will ensure that all the tools and libraries needed for your SaaS application are correctly installed and ready to use.

1. **Clone Your New Repository**: First, you need to clone the repository you just created from the Open Micro SaaS template to your local machine. Replace `your-username` and `your-repository-name` with your GitHub username and the name of your new repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Change into your project's directory which you've just cloned to your local machine:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

Using `npm ci` instead of `npm install` not only ensures that you're working with the correct versions of dependencies but also typically results in faster installation times. It's particularly beneficial for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments and when setting up a new development environment to match the project's specified dependencies precisely.

**Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**

Set up your environment variables by copying the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file. This file will store crucial configurations for your project.

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # Use 'copy' command on Windows
```

**Step 4: Set Up Next Auth Secret**

Secure your application by generating a Next auth secret. This key adds an extra layer of security to your user authentication process.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

For detailed instructions, refer to [Next Auth's documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#description-1).

**Step 5: Database Configuration**

Input your database credentials in the `.env` file. The default `docker-compose.yml` is set with the following placeholders; adjust according to your preferences:

```bash
POSTGRES_HOST=127.0.0.1
POSTGRES_PORT=6500
POSTGRES_USER=your-user-that-you-want
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-password-that-you-want
POSTGRES_DB=your-db-that-you-want
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your-user-that-you-want:your-password-that-you-want@localhost:6500/your-db-that-you-want?schema=public"
```

Ensure consistency in the `DATABASE_URL` and individual Postgres environment variables.

**Step 6: Initialize the Database**

Use Docker to set up your PostgreSQL database. If you haven't installed Docker, [find the installation guide here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```bash
npm run db:start
```

Alternatively, if you have PostgreSQL installed locally or you want to use a remote database, you can set up your database manually and update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable accordingly.

**Step 7: Run the migrations**

Run the migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:dev
```

This command will create the necessary tables and relationships in your database.

**Step 8: Launch the Development Server**

Everything's set! Start the development server and begin building:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your server will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Testing

This project comes with a suite of integration tests to ensure that everything is functioning as expected.

For more information on how to run these tests, refer to the [Testing](/testing) section of the documentation.
