# Lets start building your SaaS project with Open Micro SaaS

Welcome to the beginning of your journey with Open Micro SaaS, the ultimate Next.js-based toolkit designed to streamline the development of your SaaS project.

This guide will walk you through the setup process, from cloning the repository to running your first set of integration tests. Let's get your project off the ground.

## Installation

**Step 1: Create Your Project from the Template**

Instead of directly cloning the Open Micro SaaS repository, you'll start by creating a new repository based on our GitHub template (instructions bellow).

The easiest way to use this template, is running:

```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/product-makers-hub/open-micro-saas
```

This script will create a new Next.js project using the Open Micro SaaS template. You are good to go to step 2!

If you prefer to do it manually, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Open Micro SaaS Template Repository**: Go to the [Open Micro SaaS public template on GitHub](https://github.com/product-makers-hub/open-micro-saas).
2. **Use the Template**: Click the "Use this template" button near the top right of the repository page.
3. **Set Up Your Repository**: Choose a name for your new repository and decide if it will be public or private. Then, click "Create repository from template" to generate your new project repository.

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Once you've created your project repository from the Open Micro SaaS template, the next step is to set up your project environment by installing the necessary dependencies. This will ensure that all the tools and libraries needed for your SaaS application are correctly installed and ready to use.

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Change into your project's directory which you've just cloned to your local machine:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

Using `npm ci` instead of `npm install` not only ensures that you're working with the correct versions of dependencies but also typically results in faster installation times. It's particularly beneficial for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments and when setting up a new development environment to match the project's specified dependencies precisely.

**Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**

Set up your environment variables by copying the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file. This file will store crucial configurations for your project.

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # Use 'copy' command on Windows
```

**Step 4: Set Up Next Auth Secret**

Secure your application by generating a Next auth secret. This key adds an extra layer of security to your user authentication process.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

For detailed instructions and alternatives, refer to [Next Auth's documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#description-1).

**Step 5: Database Configuration**

Input your database credentials in the `.env` file. The default `docker-compose.yml` is set with the following placeholders; adjust according to your preferences:

```bash
POSTGRES_HOST=127.0.0.1
POSTGRES_PORT=6500
POSTGRES_USER=your-user-that-you-want
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-password-that-you-want
POSTGRES_DB=your-db-that-you-want
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your-user-that-you-want:your-password-that-you-want@localhost:6500/your-db-that-you-want?schema=public"
```

Ensure consistency in the `DATABASE_URL` and individual Postgres environment variables.

**Step 6: Initialize the Database**

Use Docker to set up your PostgreSQL database. If you haven't installed Docker, [find the installation guide here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```bash
npm run db:start
```

As alternative, you can use the following options to set up your database without Docker:

1. To use a remote database.
2. To use a local [PostgreSQL installation](https://www.postgresql.org/) in your machine.

Make sure to update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file accordingly if you choose one of these options.

**Step 7: Run the migrations**

Run the migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:dev
```

This command will create the necessary tables and relationships in your database.

**Step 8: Launch the Development Server**

Everything's set! Start the development server and begin building:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your server will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Creating an admin user

To create an admin user, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run script:create:admin
```

This will read your `ADMIN_EMAIL` env variable and create an admin user with the provided email address.

Notice that you need to have your development database running.
