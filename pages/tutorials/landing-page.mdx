# Landing Page Customization Tutorial

Welcome to the Landing Page Customization Tutorial for Open Micro SaaS! This guide will walk you through the process of personalizing your application's landing page using our pre-built UI components crafted with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn.

You'll learn how to effortlessly update your landing page's copy and appearance directly through the `landingPageContent` configuration object, without the need to modify the React components themselves.

## Overview

Open Micro SaaS comes equipped with a set of responsive, aesthetically pleasing UI components designed to make your landing page not only visually appealing but also highly functional.

These components, combined with the flexibility of Tailwind CSS, allow for extensive customization options, including theme switching between dark and light modes.

## Configuring Your Landing Page

The heart of your landing page's customization lies within the `landingPageContent` object, located in `src/config/landing-page-config.ts`. This object is structured to reflect the different sections of your landing page, including:

- Hero Section
- Features Overview
- How It Works
- Why Choose Us
- Testimonials
- Call to Action
- Footer

### Example:

```js
export const landingPageContent = {
  heroSection: {
    headline: "Your Custom Headline",
    subheadline: "Your engaging subheadline goes here.",
    cta: "Start Free Trial",
    figureImage: "https://link.to/your/image.jpg",
  },
  // Additional sections follow...
};
```

By editing this configuration object, you can easily adjust the text, images, and call-to-action links across your landing page to align with your brand and messaging.

## Utilizing UI Components

Located under `src/app/(public)/_components`, the pre-built UI components such as Hero, Features, Footer, etc., dynamically render the content based on the `landingPageContent` configuration.

This modular approach enables you to customize each section's content directly through the configuration file, offering a seamless way to update your landing page as your project evolves.

### Customizing UI Components

While the default UI components provide a solid foundation for your landing page, you're encouraged to further customize these components to fit your unique needs.

Whether it's adjusting the layout, changing styling with Tailwind CSS, or adding new components, Open Micro SaaS is designed to support your creative vision.

#### Tailwind Configuration:

For deeper customization, including theme adjustments for dark and light modes, refer to the `tailwind.config.ts` file.
